cat _file_ = read all
cat clocks | grep "clock1" = read all clock properties
cat clocks | grep "clock1.time" = read time

sed -i 's/original/new/g' file.txt  { //replace words in the file

    Explanation:

        sed = Stream EDitor
        -i = in-place (i.e. save back to the original file)

        The command string:
            s = the substitute command
            original = a regular expression describing the word to replace (or just the word itself)
            new = the text to replace it with
            g = global (i.e. replace all and not just the first occurrence)

        file.txt = the file name
}

sed -i '/clock3./d' clocks = delete lines in file by pattern

echo "text" >> clocks = append line to file
